I am a visiting scientist in the Theoretical Statistics and Mathematics Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India sponsored by J.C. Bose fellowship of Prof. Debashish Goswami.

In September, 2021, I shall start a one-year postdoctoral position at the Mathematical Institute of Charles University in Prague, Czechia as part of the PRIMUS grant “Spectral noncommutative geometry of quantum flag manifolds” held by Dr. R&eacute;amonn &Oacute; Buachalla.

I defended my doctoral thesis in December, 2020 at the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India under the supervision of Prof. Debashish Goswami.
