I am a postdoc at the Department of Mathematics, University of Oslo in Oslo, Norway.

Before that, I was a postdoc at the Mathematical Institute of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.

I was offered a postdoctoral position at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland but couldnâ€™t join due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.

I defended my doctoral thesis in December, 2020 at the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India under the supervision of Prof. Debashish Goswami.
