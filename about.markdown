I am a postdoc in the Mathematical Institute of the Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic as part of the PRIMUS grant “Spectral noncommutative geometry of quantum flag manifolds” held by Dr. R&eacute;amonn &Oacute; Buachalla.

Before that, I was a SERB-NPDF in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research in Kolkata, India.

Even before that, I was a visiting scientist in the Theoretical Statistics and Mathematics Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India sponsored by J.C. Bose fellowship of Prof. Debashish Goswami.

I was offered a one-year postdoctoral position at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland but couldn’t join due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.

I defended my doctoral thesis in December, 2020 at the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India under the supervision of Prof. Debashish Goswami.
