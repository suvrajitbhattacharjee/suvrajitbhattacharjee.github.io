I am a SERB-NPDF in the Department of Mathematics and Statistics of the Indian Institute of Science Education and Research, Kolkata,

Before that, I was a visiting scientist in the Theoretical Statistics and Mathematics Unit of the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India sponsored by J.C. Bose fellowship of Prof. Debashish Goswami.

I shall be a postdoc (delayed due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic) at the Mathematical Institute of Charles University in Prague, Czechia as part of the PRIMUS grant “Spectral noncommutative geometry of quantum flag manifolds” held by Dr. R&eacute;amonn &Oacute; Buachalla.

I was offered a one-year postdoctoral position at the Institute of Mathematics of the Polish Academy of Sciences, Warsaw, Poland but couldn’t join due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.

I defended my doctoral thesis in December, 2020 at the Indian Statistical Institute in Kolkata, India under the supervision of Prof. Debashish Goswami.
