I am a postdoc at the Mathematical Institute of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic as part of the PRIMUS grant “Spectral noncommutative geometry of quantum flag manifolds” held by Dr. R&eacute;amonn &Oacute; Buachalla.

My research interests are in quantum groups and noncommutative geometry.
