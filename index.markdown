I am a postdoc at the Mathematics Institute, University of Oslo in Oslo, Norway.

Before that, I was a postdoc at the Mathematical Institute of Charles University in Prague, Czech Republic.

I was offered a postdoctoral position at the Institute of Mathematics of the
Polish Academy of Sciences in Warsaw, Poland but could not join due to travel restrictions caused by the pandemic.

I defended my doctoral thesis in December, 2020 at the Indian Statistical
Institute in Kolkata, India under the supervision of Prof. Debashish Goswami. My
thesis can be found

My research interests are in operator algebras, quantum groups and
noncommutative geometry. 

My postal address is: Matematisk institutt, Universitetet i Oslo, P.O. Box 1053,
